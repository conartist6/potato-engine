## Potato Engine

This project is an engine for 2D games, particularly for simple box-pushing kinds. Its primary goal is to facilitate educational game creation, and whimsical game prototyping.

The engine has some basic game mechanics built in. For example if you're pushing a box, you can't push it onto another box.

The engine itself is agnostic as to how the game is rendered.

Currently the engine does not support animations.
