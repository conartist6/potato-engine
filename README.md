This project is in alpha.

## History

Potato-engine was inspired in particular by Kye, and during initial development was called kye-engine. Kye is a 1992 game created by Colin Garbutt, who is not affiliated with this project. Kye is retained as the reference game implementation on the engine.

I would also like to thank:

Colin Phipps of [Python Kye](http://games.moria.org.uk/kye/download-install) whose implementation of the Kye game saved me a significant amount of time tracking down some of the finer points of Kye's game mechanics when I was first starting the project.

The authors of Xye, a game which more fully explores the mechanics which might be possible in a kye-like game and helped me make fewer assumptions in my code.

Max Hardcastle. For opening the burgers issue, and for being excited generally.
