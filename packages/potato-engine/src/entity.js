 * An entity represents a game playing piece in the potato engine. All pieces which wish to participate in the game
 * must derive from this class. Each entity subclass is likely to have particular behaviors which define it,
 * as well as a particular visual presentation so that players know what they should expect it to do.
 *
 * The visual presentation is not part of the base entity, but the combination of the class name and attribute
 * is currently required to be sufficient in order for the renderer to choose the correct sprite/styling.
 *
 * Entities may be either abstract or concrete. An abstract entity is not associated with any in-progress game
 * (a Board instance), whereas a concrete one is. In particular, a concrete entity is passed a state instance as
 * its third parameter.
 *
 * Abstact entities are suitable for describing levels, for example, whereas to use the mutative methods
 * (e.g. move or eat) you must have a concrete entity.
 *
 * You should never try to create concrete entities yourself. Rather the board, given an abstract entity, will
 * bind to it, resulting in the concrete instance on which your method implementations will be called.
 *
 * No derived entity may define a constructor which takes different parameters than this one.
